VBA Next port for the RS-97, Retrostone, Bittboy etc...
=========================================================

This is a direct port of libretro VBA Next to the Retrostone and other handleds.
It comes with the same menu that i made for SMS Plus GX (it is GPLv2+ licensed of course), including support for save states and EEPROM/SRAM saves.

The common codebase means that it is fairly portable to embedded handleds.

This can pretty much run everything you throw at it bar a few games like Hello Kitty, Madden 06, and Sonic Pinball Party when you try to resume arcade mode.
